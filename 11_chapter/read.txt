The courageous fallen!
The anguished fallen! 
Their lives have meaning because we the living refuse to forget them! 
And as we ride to certain death, 
we trust our successors to do the same for us! 
Because my soldiers do not buckle or yield 
when faced with the cruelty of this world! 
My soldiers push forward! 
My soldiers scream out! 
My soldiers RAAAAAGE!
