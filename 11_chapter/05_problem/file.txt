#### laws #### electromagnetic induction are two fundamental laws #### describe how electric currents and magnetic fields interact. Here they are:

#### First ####
#### First #### #### Electromagnetic Induction states #### a change in the magnetic environment #### a coil #### wire will induce an electromotive force (emf) in the coil. This induced emf is proportional to the rate #### change #### the magnetic flux.

#### Second ####
#### Second #### #### Electromagnetic Induction states #### the magnitude #### the induced emf in a coil is directly proportional to the rate #### change #### magnetic flux through the coil.
